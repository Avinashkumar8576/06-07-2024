this: When class fields names and constructor/method parameters are same then we 
      have to differentiate class fields with 'this' keyword from constructor/method 
      parameters
      
this(): In a class calling one constructor to another constructor using this() method,
        this process we can called constructor chaining.

For example,


public Department()//default
{
	this(110, "HR");
	departmentId = 7878;
	departmentName = "Deployment";
}
	
public Department(int departmentId, String departmentName)//parameterized
{
	this.departmentId = departmentId;
	this.departmentName = departmentName;
}
